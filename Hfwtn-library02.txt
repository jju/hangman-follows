# scenes from a library

## A Dialogue (recurring)

The search for knowledge, nay for truth, drives us, or consumes us, or it should.

Sure. Conceded to the great arbiter.

You make fun, but this is important and it's troubling. You say you share my quest, yet you are satisfied with this lot we've drawn, with serving up falsehoods.

Falsehoods and fictions bring comfort to many.

I suppose that's true, but unsatisfying. Why don't you try for something better, something that actually approaches the dreams we share?

That attempt though, that's just about me. You say you want to serve people with knowledge and truth, but we both know that's impossible here. That quest is internal and nobody but you and I care about it. 

But aren't we the best to judge what we should be doing and how we should be using our talents?

Perhaps, but why be so selfish about it? I mean, look at this chap. He is large and rude. His splayed eyes may indicate some sort of brain injury. How can we have our skills and yet not use them for his benefit? Why would you deny him whatever tiny shred of truth we can find?

Therein lies the problem. 'What are these shreds of truth made of?' What can these poor facsimiles change? We know there is only one truth and it serves no one with a smile.

Well yes, you have always been a little bleak for me.

On the day Bing arrived for work in the library, he was the happiest being in the realm. He'd escaped the world of counters and costs and the idea of sharing instead of selling had dazzled him. Now he would be able to give only the best, without consideration of lines on the bottoms of contracts. It was a pure and idealistic world to work in a library, helping without direct reward. It soothed something in his soul, and the opportunity meant he was loath to question the target of his allegiance.

It didn't take long for the edge to be knocked off and to realize he was still working for the loathsome Marquesa, no matter his ideals. He was tied into a system of horror that didn't stop when coin stopped changing hands. The system was all-pervasive.

In truth, there was no one as bleak as Bing in all the Jib. For honest and for true.
