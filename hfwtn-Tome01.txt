# Tome Visits the Sworn Lands

## In Which Tome is Part of a Procession

Hours and hours before the mountain lord's estate -- little more than a waystation on the road, but significant in these border areas -- it became clear Tome was approaching a party.

All morning she had passed mules laden to the point of sympathetic winces from even the most animal-averse passerby. The mules were driven by impoverished young arrogances who would have had more fellow feeling with their animals if their loads were heavier than whips, whistles and bells.

There were also old men & women with giant bales of sticks balanced on stooped shoulders. So many members of the aged crowd were also carrying large orange fish, not in bowls of glass or sacks of leather, but in delicate twine harnesses that gave the insensate creatures a natural swimming orientation even as they gasped and drowned.

But crowds of people -- noticeably unsoldierly people -- carrying goods don't signify a party on their own. There could have been a tax day, a census, some sort of massive barnraising or emergency going on. Even a jumped-up market day run by buttoneers and smirkers needs material to fuel it. Out in the Counter Realms such grim occasions of redistribution might have had a similar human-powered line of supply.

This human stream Tome found herself immersed in was headed to a festive occasion, though, not the grim mill of commerce. There were many more musicians straggling along on the carts than anyone would need otherwise. On several occasions as Tome passed a groaning cart filled with jealous guardians of delicate wood, metal and twine the musicians would ask her to suggest a tune, most likely to make sure they were up on the local tastes and sensibilities.

Tome ignored those questions. It would only have confused the issue when they sought clarification and confirmation, scrambling through their memories and records of the songs they knew. Tome's tastes were decidedly not local, and there was no reason to think the musicians would be punished for not having her songs at their fingertips. It was better for the musicians not to waste their time, since rumour had it that lords of the Sworn Lands had cruel streaks. Though perhaps those rumours were false. Perhaps the lord of Fandei manor would not pull out the fingernails of musicians who did not know his (or her? Tome's research hadn't been especially thorough) favourites from days long gone.

Once Tome had been asked nearly a dozen times for a song her sympathy for the musicians began to erode. A young woman with a whisker on her cheek leaned from the cart she rode in and said "Hey there brother, come on, quit your long facing and give us a tune. We might make you happy."

Tome picked up her pace and shook her head.

"Come on! Just a song!"

And Tome tossed a remark over her shoulder. In many other places we could say she tossed it away, that it floated off on the wind, but she didn't say it just any place. She said it in the Sworn Lands.

"Apologies," she said, "I don't know any."

## In Which Tome Enters the Sworn Lands and Promptly Falls Into a Trap

The gap Tome had chosen for her entrance into the Sworn Lands was not the most popular, at least not usually. She had chosen it specifically for that reason, not that she had a secret mission -- oh no, definitely not that -- she preferred to see a new place from the backwater first. Walking along this track into the Sworn Lands was a slow method for gaining access, but Tome took pride in having more time than impatience.

She had not expected to be surrounded by pedestrian revellers on the track. Tome expressed her puzzlement by furrowing her brow and extending her strides. Now she was a little faster than the crowd, but subtly, like she was naturally long-limbed. 

Weaving in and around the people dressed roughly and laughing loudly, she considered her strides. Everything was an anachronism here of course, but she liked to think of this as "messenger pace." The celestial creators of course had means of communication that did not require a woman to be a messenger, stretching her legs unnaturally. There was no fundamental reason for them not to share thoughts, conversation, communion as if they shared a bath.

But here she was, dragging herself through a labyrinth (metaphorical, of course - the pass through the mountains was quite obvious) with less-than-lofty purposes.

When the waystation became visible after hours of ups and downs weaving through the press of humanity, Tome's lower body quietly rejoiced. There would be comforts ahead of her, according to her research. The looming mountains had caverns where healing minerals and other substances collected, so baths were supposed to be common on the route Tome followed.

The thought of steam dominated Tome's thoughts as she approached the dour-faced greeters and cheerful enforcers and all the rest of the gate-accoutrements accompanying a minor lord's country home. The human guardianship was all for show. The lord, or at least the lord's house was already completely aware of all its visitors, who would be passing through and who would be seeking hospitality. Rooms had already been assigned, and for repeat visitors the appropriate kitchens would be making preparations. All these visitors had arrived through the mountain pass, and the mountains were designed to be the true screening test. All the shuffling and questioning at the gates was purely to instill the correct kind of mood.

Tome's shuffling was not for show. She often had trouble summoning the correct mood for official occasions. The guards who weren't guarding anything and were thus superfluous wanted to be feared (or possibly respected in a manner indistinguishable from fear). The masters wanted to be respected, but if you feared them instead, well that was okay too. The rest of your fellow humans just wanted to get along without too much trouble.

When one of the guards started calling out "Tome! We're looking for a visitor named Tome!" she was less than pleased. But in the interests of keeping trouble to a minimum, she gathered up her little blue pack and shuffled to the bellower.

The bellower was large and solid, a veritable symbol of her role in defending the manor and its inhabitants. Tome was unimpressed by these kinds of direct, unsubtle correspondences. The philosophy embodied was along the lines of don't put a guard out who doesn't look like a wall. You use the small and slender folk with those kinds of skills for lurking and watching. It was an obvious way to do things. Tome flinched with the effort of suppressing a reaction, which was a reaction of its own, she realized. One the waystation probably caught anyway. 

I'm new here, Tome thought, just a visitor for the holiday.

"You're Tome?" the wall-woman asked.

"I am."

The guard beckoned Tome to come closer, though with the difference in heights it meant mutual neck-strain. Tome again, tried to keep her reaction internal, but could not help considering what a boring art physical intimidation was. Now she would have to crick her neck and the guard would have to stoop and no one would be comfortable. And for no reason. It's a shame, Tome thought, but this is why you travel: to learn how other folk see the world. And evidently this part of the world had no problem with looking at the top of her head.

"Remove your hood."

"This is a problem? Surely you know who I am. What kind of impediment is the hood causing?" Words aside, she had begun removing the hood at once. It was true though. These servants manning the gates could know far more about any of the crowd than could be hidden by mere fabric, no matter how clever its design. Tome continued unwrapping her travelling scarf to be in full compliance.

"And you were walking up this road earlier today?"

"Of course I was. I believe it is the only road from the Counter lands, which is where I've recently been."

The guard blinked. Tome considered her for a moment. Perhaps she had been too harsh in her assessment of obviousness. This guard was a functionary, a living cog in the machinery of the world. When such creatures do the work that earns their keep they are in many ways attempting neutrality. They try their best to construct themselves in this way. The goal is an interchangeability and impartiality, so no one subject to their gaze is treated any differently than any other. Which in some circumstances is laudable, and may be more subtle than Tome gave credit for.

"Did you pass a group of musicians on the path?"

Of course Tome had, but she took a moment or two to feign taking the time to recollect the day's travel. Some call this playing dumb, but Tome considered not letting everything you're thinking out into the world as her version of the functionary's impartiality.

When Tome nodded, the guard said. "Please speak aloud in interactions with the Manor house."

This was a moment where she could have realized what was happening, but Tome had arrived from the Counter lands where nobody cared what you said as long as the sums came out right. Her research was not complete and Tome was not prepared to be as wary as she should have been. She was dealing with power here, and foolishly (so foolishly) she spoke to it.

"Yes I did. I believe we exchanged chit-chat."

The guard did not light up. What happened instead was a tension somewhere released as new gears came into play. Despite herself, Tome was interested. The muscles around the guard's eyes twitched before her blink and her left hand flashed behind her back and she rose on the balls of her feet. It was obvious to everyone crowding through the waystation gates that something was happening. They gawked, not quite slack-jawed, but with the air of impending doom they'd get to witness. That it was happening to someone that was not one of them, someone they did not know, made it that much more exciting. Tome could sense the awe in the crowd that they'd see so clearly something that they'd only heard in whispers before.

Tome knew then that she'd made a mistake, but it was still not quite clear what the mistake had been. It probably wasn't entirely opening her mouth in the first place. She'd been asked questions and complied to the best of her ability. She'd done what she could and things were about to go terribly wrong.

"Thank you for your cooperation Tome-Visitor." The guard was joined by three more from the same mold. They'd arrived from the other side of the gate, where the rest of the crowd was being processed without delay. "You will now come with us."

Tome nodded, made a motion like she was going to speak and then withdrew it. There was no point to running. At this point Tome had the attention of Power on me and one needed very special abilities to avoid that gaze. Tome could not turn invisible, or flee on the wind. She was just a regular soul travelling this realm with a little blue sack. There was nothing to do in the face of actual force, even if Tome were sure what these functionaries' powers extended to. Was this the kind of place where they'd be able to stomp a person into paste without repercussion? Those places exist, and if this was one of them Tome was not keen to be a lesson to others about doing your research before leaving home.

The guards took the opportunity of Tome not speaking to surround her, and she nodded. It was an indication that yes she would comply with their suggestions, but speaking wasn't an option. A sentence could change a lot of details quickly.

They walked through the gate. The guards all matched Tome's pace exactly, like an unnerving honour guard. The effect was spoiled by the averted gazes from every being in the manor-village. They studied the mud and the cobbles rather than get noticed by the entourage.

/* IMPORTANT? I DON"T THINK SO Staring at two of the guards' broad backs, Tome noticed they had a variation on the insignia from the road security forces. It was a symbol I'd seen before, but at the moment I was unlikely to be free to do any research. It bothered me though. */

The group arrived in the shadow of the manor house. House is, of course, a misnomer, as the place had impeccable high walls that no dog would dare to piss on, and those walls seemed to enclose vast amounts of space. It was all very grand in a rustic kind of way. Tome was not at all surprised at the squat windowless building she was led to instead.

There was a short hallway, a cage where Tome deposited her pack and emptied her pockets. Finally, there was a cell. It had no bars and resembled the sort of place a monk would sleep and try to meditate. To her later chagrin, Tome entered without protest. Obviously, she could not hope to change anything once she was about to be taken. It seemed like a better idea to just roll with the situation and figure a way out of it later. But traps are made to be tricky and it's hard to say if she ever did escape this one.

## In Which Tome Spends Time in a Cell

Tome was ready to while away days in the cell. Not months or years, but days were definitely doable. It seemed like the kind of thing that could happen. You cross a border these days and you give up your right to think that anything happening to you is undeserved. What are you doing going wandering aound if you aren't prepared to be imprisoned for a while? That seemed almost reasonable.

Many others don't believe that to be the case. When those sorts of people travel beyond their very specific zone of comfort pandering to their presumed tastes they will have a bit tougher a time than Tome was anticipating. As you read this you might think Tome smug and condescending, and Tome was nothing if not self-aware, so she caught herself thinking the same thing. Since she was thinking this while sitting on a hard bunk staring at a well-mortared wall she considered it a form of confidence boosting she was comfortable indulging in.

She was able to indulge that sentiment for quite some time.

No one came to the cell for days. There was a faucet and a bucket with a drain made of a suspiciously modern ceramic. There was a small cupboard with crackers that held more nutrients than you might expect. Tome ate and drank and relieved herself at regular intervals, but not in a regimented fashion. She couldn't tell exact times so she did what she needed to do when she felt like it, and considered how much that assuaged the feeling of imprisonment. Having control over the essentials gave her little reason to make a fuss. It was like being on a purifying retreat. She knew people who did that kind of thing occasionally. There had been times when Tome travelled to some new exotic place and just stayed in a room the entire time, so who's to say that's not what she would have been doing anyway?

The cell had no windows. The walls were extraordinarily thick because quiet as Tome was, she heard nothing through them. It reminded her of a cave she stayed stayed in in another Kneeler land. The walls of that place were whitewashed and was stocked with many more blankets than a random cave in the wilderness would have been, but the immensity of the walls and their blocking of the outside world was impressive. Outside that cave Tome had completely missed a wicked thunderstorm, one that uprooted whole trees. This cell felt similar.

And what Tome missed out on behind these thick walls ended up more significant than an uprooted tree.

## In Which Tome Speaks Incautiously

When Tome heard the knock, she was too surprised to do more than look up at the door as it opened. One of the massive functionaries entered and flicked her eyes over the cell. Tome rated as lingering a gaze as the ceiling. The guard stepped back before Tome could slip her legs over the side of the bunk towards the open door and a small man stepped in.

The insides of his thick sleeves were worn shiny by his wrists. His jacket was a heavy, formal thing, with a subtle pattern woven into it. His face was narrow but bent, like looking at a battle mangled sword edge-on.

"You are Tome-Criminal?" He asked the question without looking at her. Evidently, the cell's ceiling had some fascinating aspect.

"My name is Tome."

"Who do you know in Fandei Manor?" He was sweeping the ceiling with his gaze now.

"I don't know anyone in Fandei Manor," Tome said. "I assume that's the name of this place?"

That got his attention. He pressed his left wrist to his temple and winced like he was keeping something inside a shell. "You do not even know of the house in which you are a guest? This is a most distressing piece of news. Most distressing." 

Tome shrugged. She remained sitting on her bunk.

"This is most distressing but there is no alternative. You need to clean up and follow me into the presence of..." He switched hands on his head for a moment before collecting himself. He clasped hands behind his back, muscles and tendons radiating flickering tension. But he breathed deeply.

"You will follow me now."

"All right. I'll have to gather my wardrobe."

Swordface's hands flew to his head and he began bellowing. "You do not have a wardrobe! There is no wardrobe for you to collect!" He tossed a glance over his shoulder as a guard entered. "Why would you even say such a thing?"

Tome had already stood and did her best not to flinch. "It was a joke. I don't have anything but I said I had lots of stuff. It was a joke. It's no big deal."

Swordface's deep breathing took wild control over him, enough that both Tome and the guard exchanged looks. But he got control over himself and eventually spoke again. "You are in the Sworn Lands. Speaking untruths here is not permitted. Speaking untruths to the lord of the house will be most upsetting to everyone. Do not do so, especially not with the Marquesa in attendance. Or it will be the doom of all of us."

Okay, Tome thought. No jokes. And three more guards entered to take her away.

## In Which Tome Makes Acquaintance with Power

There was, obviously, a long way through the waystation/manor house in the village known as Fandei. That route allowed for contemplation of the majestic mountains it nestled in with a soupcon of the squalour of people lucky enough to be caught in the shadow of their betters. Such a path would serve to reinforce the oft-repeated phrase that in the Sworn Lands "mountains cast shadows; power does likewise."

There's a story about a young woman from Fandei who went to try and win her true love's heart by finding a sword of incomparable lightness and strength. After many harsh adventures she found this weapon and returned home with it and stood before her true love, placing it at his feet. The lover scorned he, rejecting the notion that strength and light were of any use to a person who lived in the shadow of the mountains. There they needed heavy things to survive the darkness. The adventuring young woman denied this, claiming the value of the weightless void and she was cast out of the land. The sword remained in the true love's house, where it had a heavy scabbard made for it. And it was never drawn again.

Tome didn't know this story, but everyone who wasn't an ill-prepared tourist in Fandei would have. 

Swordface led the little entourage through tunnels that were more efficient than picturesque. There was a whole warren of these passages below the street level, and they passed through a number of crossing with hunched and stooping people bustling about under the glow of a phosphorescent moss lining the ceiling.

Tome appreciated the moss. It was a nice touch not to have flickering torches or lamps that gave off smoke, though she assumed that would also fit the setting. The moss glowed clean and to Tome at least, gave a sense that someone knew what they were doing when they contructed this place. That was good. Tome had opinions on craftsmanship, and this detail pleased her.

Their path corkscrewed up ancient stairs and Tome found herself in open corridors, followed by a drafty passageway through a stone wall then up again into wood, fragrant and flexible. Once they were up in these domains, Swordface's tension levels rose again, along with his sleeves. He stopped the group at a door that would slide on a frame. The room beyond was in no way soundproof or even opaque. Servants and other householdfolk gathering down the hall. Whatever was about to happen would be at least a little bit public.

Tome's shoulders were seized by guards, and Swordface whispered directly in her ear. "You are entering the presence of the Marquesa of the Sworn Lands. If you make any attempt at violence you will be dead before you can raise your hand. Do not speak an untruth to her. You have commited enough crimes." He nodded and one of the guards slid the door open for Tome to step through. When she did, the guards with hands on her kept pace.

The room was a library. There were a few paintings on the walls but mostly the room was lined with books. Tome studied them and their apparent depth with consideration of the delicate-feeling floor. It was entirely possible the shelves were an illusion created by storing only the spines of the books. She had been in such unscrupulous libraries before. The room wasn't tall enough for the tool every bibliophile in the history of bibliology has wanted to try: the ladder on wheels. This floor seemed delicate but Tome decided it was probably strong enough to support the knowledge the shelves purported to store.

The room's atmosphere was entirely elevated by the Marquesa's presence. She was not a slender woman. There was no question of trying to portray herself as frail and innocent. The Marquesa was built like the guards, though her clothes were more refined. Tome guessed the Marquesa could not punch through a wall, but there wasn't anything about her to suggest she couldn't coil herself up like a spring and vault right over the mountains.

The Marquesa's skin was dark, a shadowy green that resembled ocean depths. There were scars on her face disappearing down into her scarf. Her stillness exuded power and majesty. Tome's guards kneeled, but she only made a tiny reflexive flicker of a twitch towards doing the same.

The Marquesa was reading. It was a children's adventure tale of Dai and Bo the mismatched twins who went off to retrieve the sixth sword from the obsidian circle. It's a good story and one full of adventure if you like swords. A lot of people in the Sworn Lands did. 

"How do you like it?" she asked. If Tome had known the book her usual question was to ask if it held up on rereading. That's the question she thought lets you know what is going on inside a person.

The Marquesa looked up at me from under a raised eyebrow that could have been carved into her face.

"I mean, it's important to know what the last book you liked was. It's always kind of sad to find people who can read but don't." This was not the most politic tack to take, thought Tome, but hell can only burn you once, right? "I mean, they told me I was here to find you something worth your time, so what do you want? Something like that?"

Out in the hall there was a commotion as Swordface fainted, not only from Tome's audacity to speak falsely and - worse yet - to entangle him in it. The Marquesa did not react.

She flipped a page. "Are you the woman named for a book?" The Marquesa's voice was low but with a rancid curl to it. Smoky tea with a lemon that had gone off.

"No ma'am I was not. My father died before my birth. I am named for his tombstone. My mother didn't spell too well."

This time her chin rose from the posture of reading. "Are you making a joke?" She asked the question like an ice-fisher testing his footing early in the spring.

"I am not."

"Because I do not know how ignorant you are of this realm, I feel I should warn you about the amount of trouble you're already in. Plus of course the far more troublesome trouble you have no part of.

"You have knowingly borne false witness in the Sworn Lands. It is a matter of principle and law that all in the Sworn Lands, even visitors, speak no word of falsehood. You have done this. You have admitted you did this to the apparatus of state and this has sealed your punishment.""

Toe took a few moments to wish she had taken her pre-trip research a bit more seriously. "Am I allowed to ask what my punishment is?"

The Marquesa smiled and returned her attention to her book. "There are options, especially for someone like myself. If I were not here, you would be executed. You're a foreigner of little importance here, and it would be best to cut you off right at the nub to set an example for other outsiders wishing to make fun of our traditions.

"But I am here, so there are options. Exile and banishment would be the lenient choice, but one I would have to work too hard to defend. This will not be my choice. The Sworn Lands are not a place for mercy.

"We could have gone with a mutilation or confiscation of all your wealth, and though I see you sigh a bit there, thinking you have not much wealth with you, our grasp is very long and we could destroy your hopes anywhere you might find yourself." She glanced up from her book again. "Anywhere."

"We are doing none of those things today. Though I suppose we will be incidentally confiscating any wealth you might have. For, you see, we're confiscating you."

Tome stared back at the Marquesa's forehead.

"You have now been hired by myself and thus on behalf of the entire Sworn Lands to solve a mystery."

That didn't sound so bad. If there's one thing Tome enjoyed, it's playing detective. It was probably all the stories she'd read as a youngster where individuals outside the whole apparatus of law could do exactly what the bureaucracy could not. Not that Tome phrased it in terms of bureaucracy and the "apparatus of law" back in those days. It was more the idea of solving a puzzle and doing it by yourself that was the enticement. [BLECH REWORK]

The Marquesa stared at her, waiting for a response. Whichever school of intimidation she did her finishing at was an odd one. She didn't focus on Tome's eyes, or face or even that spot just over your shoulder that was all the rage for a few years in certain circles (though it led to so many clueless bystanders embroiled in intrigues way above their station). She watched Tome's fingers.

Tome tried to wait her out. There was nothing about this situation that was going to give the Marquesa any more power, but she wanted to see how long this woman with ultimate control over all the Sworn Lands could go without baring her teeth, metaphorically speaking. While she watched Tome's fingers, her nostrils flickered and her lips twitched. Her lips parted like she was speaking, and her teeth flashed along with her tongue, which was a far brighter blue than the green of her skin was dark.

But her eyes never left Tome's fingers (the ones of her left, non-dominant hand) which soon twitched of their own accord. When that happened, a tiny unsettling smirk began to pull at her mouth. Tome wanted very much to move, to brush hair from her face, to do something about the phantom contact the Marquesa's gaze was insinuating.

"This is an odd situation," Tome said, and the Marquesa broke her gaze.

"Of course. It pays to be so." She behaved like a normal person again, eyes flickering, not looking at all like she was carved with tools quite anachronistic to this setting. "What has happened is this. The lord of Fandei Manor has been killed. It was to be his daughter's wedding three days ago. Are you aware of this?"

Tome shook her head. "I guess that's what the party was going to be for."

"The lordling was marrying some other lordling from some other stronghold nearer the succession line of one of the greater Sworn Lands families. But the politics don't hold any concern for you." This was a line she sounded very practiced in giving, as the Marquesa was an expert in what concerns were held by whom.

"Two days ago the lord of Fandei manor was found dead. Yesterday was to be the wedding. Everything went straight to Hell. All the families, both senior and junior to the Fandeis and the whoever they ares," she flicked a finger's worth of dismissal at the notion of these families whose politics deemed unnecessary, "well, they're all tearing each other apart blaming each other for the death and the confusion over what this means for the wedding and the inheritances and all the tedious bullshit of the provinces. Do you follow?"

Tome nodded.

"Then you see why I'm confiscating you?" Now she used a more conventional stare-down.

Tome considered, then met the Marquesa's stare. "I suppose it's because I was in the jail at the time so I could not have performed the murder. And no one here knows me and I have no connections and would thus be most impartial."

The Marquesa held her gaze. "Those are true statements, but they are not sufficient. You are going to be the investigator, judge and executioner in this case because you have proven that you are a liar. And that means that you are most emphatically not impartial. You are owned by me. You are a seeker of truth, as all are in the Sworn Lands, but you have also proven that you have no place here, that you are incapable of functioning as a human being, that you are worthless trash that I can dispose of as I wish. You are to be terrified small Tome, for you are about to be destroyed, but... that can all go away if you do this task satisfactorily. Then exile will be your lot and we will trouble you no more."

Tome asked when she could get started.

## In Which Tome Plays Detective

"When I arrived in my lord's room he was behind a screen. I placed his tea on the sideboard and left. I didn't turn my back on him. Even if he had his own back turned, somehow he would know. I removed myself quickly. I was in the room for no more than a dozen breaths."

The lord's household was filled with people. An unbelievable number of people for a world like this. Tome was fascinated by the quantity of people who would want to live like this in a realm like this, just to maintain a certain semblance of life for the Lord of Fandei. Self-sufficient he was not.

"The lord didn't move when I entered. He didn't move when I laid his garments on his bed. He didn't say anything. I didn't see him. He was behind a screen."

And the house itself was huge. Swordface had made a terrible grimaced and nearly shat himself when the Marquesa herself opened the door and gave him instructions to see to the desires of the fact-finder who was now under her particular protection. She became Tome-Honoured-Guest without further ado.

"His graciousness and moon of the mountains was coy in his refusal to have his scalp massaged and oiled. This was most irregular. We have a wonderful relationship as you well know. Or will know. There was no comfort he could find in this life apart from my fingers' deeply sensitive actions."

Tome found the Marquesa's pet position quite amenable while the morning lasted. No one really knew her role and they spoke to her without prompting. If the Marquesa had been trying to reward Tome she could not have chosen a better way.

Tome quickly learned the consciousness of status in the lord's home. It was preternaturally precise in its gradations and subgradations. Not only did everyone know their rank compared to every other being on the premises, but they left her with the distinct impression each one knew exactly how much status they needed to gain to move up the ladder. There was a facade going on, and while everyone seemed to be telling the truth, underneath it Tome sensed constant calculations. One expects that kind of thing in the Counter realms not these foreign shores. Perhaps the mountains were not as much a barrier to ideas as they made out to be.

"I brought the lord's herb and apparatus to bear as scheduled but he did not ask for it to be brought to his grasp directly. I gathered he was already under another influence. Oh, I hope you won't report that. That could be most embarassing."

On further reflection maybe this was merely a displacement of the Counter tendency. Counters like to count actual things, even if imaginary (like unicorns). These people were assigning value to slippery incorporeal ideas, and if there was a truth behind them, it seemed to Tome like that would be disappointing to them.

"The lord's foot moved once."

The seventeenth interviewee was a young boy. 

The interview room was exceedingly pleasant room with a panoramic view of the plains stretching out below Fandei. To Tome's right the walls were covered with a hyper-realistic mural of the mountains. She sat on a cushion in a stepped room it would be easy to mistake for a throne room if she hadn't been warned it was called a receiving room by Swordface. Swordface also reminded Tome, in less than subtle fashion, that calling it anything else now would be an untruth that she could ill afford. 

Swordface did not like Tome one bit. It's possible it was because Tome was a woman. There are, even in this time and place, people who feel very drawn to the idea of biology determining essential parts of our character. Swordface had a bit of that air. More likely, he didn't appreciate her attire and manner of speech and general demeanour which, if I do say so myself, has less to do with biology and more to do with other preferences. 

By this seventeenth interviewee (from a list of hundreds) Tome was starting to get the hang of this place. They wanted things to look exactly like what they were, so they could not be accused of deception, or even the appearance of such. She was surprised it took as long as it did for her to be incarcerated, this being such an inimicable land to an obfuscative person. She owed Hateswords an apology.

The boy in front of Tome was skinny and young. The word urchin floated to mind if this realm were arranged slightly differently. His dark limp hair was severely parted on the left, which was the mountain side in this room. It looked a little like a blanket laid out over the expanses, and Tome considered it. It's possible that parting was intentional, a way of subsuming himself even to the room he would be speaking in. Tome's brow furrowed.

His head was down, so contemplating his part was all that was left to her. He didn't follow his sentence up with anything more. Tome tossed a pebble into the pond. "Do you mean the lord's foot?"

He hesitated before shaking his head. She threw a larger metaphorical stone.

"So it was someone else's foot."

He startled severely like my declarative sentence had struck him. His mouth opened and closed.

"Am I telling the truth small soldier?" He blinked and Tome sighed. Being provocative might not be the best way to handle a small child. It had been a while since she'd dealt with children.

"What is your name small one?"

"I am named Shadom." He was back on his own ground now.

"What were you doing in the lord's chamber? That is where we should have started. Is it all right with you if we go back to that point?"

"I am not supposed to say."

It was tempting to ask how he'd even come into the questioning sessions then, but as far as Tome knew, the house was rounding up everyone who'd been near the premises when the lord was found dead. The list was hundreds of names long.

"I see. Why is that?"

He looked up, pleading silently for Tome to stop. The problem was that the boy couldn't say he didn't know, as he did. But he'd been told never to tell anyone about the secret he held. Tome didn't want to know the secret. If it was the kind of secret possible in a situation of power like Fandei manor held, things would get very difficult very quickly.

Please don't consider her heartless or cruel for that. Tome did have her own skin such as it was to think about. If she was to get out of this situation intact, she was supposed to find a murderer, not a horrific sex ring. That'd probably be seen as a bit of a digression from the script. It would help if Tome knew more about the Marquesa and her politics and particulars. Was she looking for incidental justice as things went by or is focus her game? She had no idea how ruthless the Marquesa might be, but the impression left was of a stone that cut glass.

But all stones cut water and Tome was already a dead woman.

"Do you know how I got here, to this house?"

The boy's head shook.

"I flew here standing on the backs of a dozen swans."

He stared, shocked. "No you didn't!"

"You speak the truth Shadom. You are much better at it than I am. I'm not going to lie to you, though, it's very important that you answer my questions. I can say a lot of things that you wouldn't say. Why don't you say something to me about what you do for the lord. What you did."

He looked hard at Tome, judging her. He saw she was the inferior worthless piece of trash in the room. She was the one who was going to be taken away and eventually dumped in the carrion pits because she was not a good human being like him. All his training and prejudice was working together and it overcame the revulsion at this woman who would say things that were nothing like the truth.

"I brought the paints for our lord's face," he said. "I was the best at applying them, and making sure no one could tell they were there. No one knew my job. On a day like this I just came in after the last of the attendants had removed themselves, and I did my work. People would say how vigorous the lord looked, how even earlier that afternoon he hadn't had that life. He was so old. He needed paints to be the strongest and most intrepid leader. The one we deserved in Fandei."

You helped him lie, Tome thought. She did not say it because once the words came out they'd be the truth.

"I entered the lord's chamber and found him dead. He twitched and spasmed. There was shit down his leg. It was brutal and ugly and wrong. This was not our lord, there defecating in his own trousers. So I dressed him and disposed of the soiled clothes and wrestled his arms from their positions. I thought he would look more dignified when someone found him. I did not know it would look like poison."

The boy was intent on staring at Tome's fingers throughout this recitiation. The haughtiness built within him as he poke. He was aping someone else's style of speech, but it did not matter. In the Sworn Lands this kind of confession seemed to be the best we would get.

"I have no idea what will happen to you now. That must have been some kind of crime you committed, even if it was just lying about the body," she said.

"I repositioned the body. I clothed it and painted his face. It was not a lie of words."

Tome considered. She could probably pass that off to the Marquesa.

"All right. That's what happened. You say it, it's the truth."

Shadom looked very self-righteous at that.

Tome dismissed Shadom and the boy turned his back on her while leaving the receiving room. If he'd known the Marquesa was behind the screen in the shadow of the painted mountains, he probably would have been a little more humble. Or maybe not. Now humility might be a new kind of deception wrung out of his character.

The Marquesa emerged from her shadows and Tome stood, stretching her shoulders. 
"Do we continue the rest of the questioning farce?" Tome asked. "It's possible we'll find out some more interesting truths. Get a pile of confessions from people even older and less likely to follow your rules. Or was he the most likely? I don't know. It's difficult being a stranger."

She stared at something just below Tome's left earlobe, so she continued her decompression. "Are we done now? Can you now do whatever you were going to do with me for lying in your precious land?"

The Marquesa laughed. "No I think you're more useful to everyone as my hireling. We'll head to the city tomorrow. I have somewhere else I'd like to keep you."
