The propagandists didn't keep much in the way of comforts out in these woods. A hand-powered printing press for rolling out pamphlets got a tarp to cover it, but the bedrolls were just heaped up by the trunks of various trees. Shadom explained they usually slept up in the branches to avoid the predators wandering the ground.
Predators?
Well yes, they say that the settlement of most of the sworn lands was entirely complete, that every inch was cultivated or being used. Every bit is obviously an exaggeration but it is true that apart from these woods I hadn't seen very much in the way of wild space. But it had been quite some time since Shadom and I had done our hike across the world.
The animals prowling these woods were dangerous if you didn't know what you were doing with them. Most of them you either needed to escape their notice by not being directly in the line of sight (hence the sleeping up in the trees) or to challenge directly when they spotted you. "Kind of like the Marquesa" Shadom said.
There was an extra bedroll for me and I was settling in.
"You know, we have the predicting blade here in camp."
"Oh. You know that the Marquesa wants me to bring it back to her, right?"
"I figured as much." He fidgeted with his blanket a while. "It seems wrong to let her have something so important doesn't it?"
To this I had no answer, mostly because I wasn't convinced it was that important. It's a legendary sword which could tell the future in a very limited way. Hooray. That's not exactly the sort of thing that makes a real difference. I mean, the sworn lands aren't the only place to live. I've been to some where they're much smarter and have godlike intelligences working on prognostication in its various forms. To tell the truth, this was a throwback, a kind of vacationland for me and even for thinking about the notion of the future. I was going to leave the sworn lands and these stupid problems behind right quickly.
