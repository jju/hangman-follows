In the woods the propagandists held court. They did this with wine and loud arguing and more than a bit of ribald swagger. Gertrude the Filth was the most interrupted of all of them. On first listen I was concerned about the others not giving her a chance to have her say. Yes her poems were boring but they didn't need a cacophony of shouted obscenities to drive her away. Shadom explained the complex style she was using acctually required the participation - it was a most subtle form of poetry, he said. "It seems boring to a painful degree, but secretly it's the raunchiest most exciting thing we do out here. Too provocative for pamphlets, really. Gertrude the Filth is our secret treasure trove."
I looked closer, and tried to listen for the occulted meanings but they weren't for me.
We'd arrived in the woods days before. I remember not being a travelling fool so I will explain to you urbanites that "the woods" is not a self-contained little area you can go to. Forests are big and patchy. There are areas of huge trees and areas of small ones. They talk about groves, which I do remember once thinking of as a bunch of trees in a meadow. That's not how these things work, not out past the cultivated agricultural world. 
Here in the Shattered Zone the trees weren't huge and lush. I've walked in some really impressive woods in my time. These were not them. The woods spread out, not over the land but under rocks and through cracks, twisting around the plants they found. I'm tempted to use choking metaphors, but they wouldn't be true. There was a lot of life going on in the weeds. Tiny green canopies at shin height. Mushrooms below, and thankfully not a surfeit of bugs hanging about.
