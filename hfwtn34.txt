To climb the wall of the library was not an onerous task. There was necessary equipment. There was necessary silence. There was necessary strength. All these sundry necessaries for a task that was anything but. 

We could have walked in the front door, been announced to the Marquesa and presented her with her silly magic sword that would tell the future of the library. The Marquesa would most definitely have preferred that approach. I hadn't realized it earlier, but she wanted the cahcet of being seen with the rebels, with the liars. I don't think she understood the way that perception works. 

She saw it as a contrast. Here is the upright and true Marquesa and here are the lying rebels, as different as can be. But people aren't that dense. When we're given an easy comparison, it's true that those who are lazy might accept it and move on, but the Sworn Lands were not a lazy land. The people in this society may not have been doing huge things but that was not due to a lack of ability.

When everything is being scrutinized the way things were in the Sworn Lands, your average person becomes more highly tuned to the hidden meanings at play. She'd been breeding a population for reading into things, for finding the lies embedded in all the truths being promulgated. Because of course nothing is true.

If we'd assembled with the Marquesa, I still believe that her citizens would have seen it as a stage full of liars. I thought that would be a suitable ending, but then I didn't have to stay here.

So instead we launched our assault.
