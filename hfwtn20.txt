We didn't run through the library. We headed very methodically downwards, around to a door in the cafeteria I'd never noticed before. And then we were out in the streets of Gallows. It was still the morning and the sky was lightening without any direct sun. The mountains blocked that sort of stuff.
We jogged lightly. I would have assumed we'd want to keep our heads down but Shadom didn't duck or hide, just kept scanning. I have to admit my sedentary life in the library had softened my feet a bit along with my middle. I was quickly out of breath and Shadom slowed for me.
"You weren't so slow when we were hiking."
"I'm built for the long haul not speed, kid."
He smirked.
"What is going to happen is we're going to grab a couple of boats to get out of Gallows. Do you know how to row a boat?"
"Basically, but I'll lay odds I'll be clumsy about it."
"No problem."
He led us to the wall keeping the water out of the sinking pit that was the town of Gallows. There were a number of heavy looking wooden boats, the kinds of things you'd use to hunt whales in, but the one Shadom headed straight for was narrower. It looked like the kind of thing you'd take on a lazy river to visit an elderly aunt, not a dramatic escape vessel. As Shadom untethered it from the anchor block on the rocks, I asked how sea-worthy it was.
"You don't need to worry about the sea."
"I think I might need to. I don't want to find my next interaction with it being the act of drowning."
He snorted. "You weren't this nervous before, I don't think."
I couldn't possibly comment.
