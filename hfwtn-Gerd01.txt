# Liberty Station

Liberty Station was originally an aspirational name. The original dwellers hemmed and hawed about including the word station. We want to be living in Liberty, not some technical filling post, they said. Calling it a station draws attention to the girders and the roughness, the rude industry we're also developing here. But from the other side of the beer stained table came the cries of drawing attention to the partial and incomplete nature of the liberty they were forumlating.

"This is no utopia. We are not trying to build a perfect city on a hill. We are in the process of constructing something, something that will never be complete. This is just a waystation."

In the end it was mostly due to labelling their oppenents utopian fools that won the day. It was never put to a vote, that's not the kind of liberty they were working towards.

Now Liberty Station is filled with the freedom of trade and industry and efficiency of markets. It's an almost perfectly closed loop of ever expanding construction and a completely absent sky. For the pragmatists it works out. For the idealists, the utopians, the pretentious arguers, it's a realm best avoided. They were driven out early and never welcomed back. You have plenty of other places you can go if you want to worry about something beyond counting up value.

But such systems can be attractive to idealists, in a  perverse and counter-intuitive way. Two of those so attracted were Hateswords and Gerd.

## Parasites

In a realm where Strexcorp and Ganterall are clashing nigh constantly over using resources for ever more ridiculous projects there is bound to be a niche for exploiting the gaps. 

This was Gerd's domain.

It was rare to find individuals in LibertyStation any more. Most had been bought up and incorporated into one of the majors long ago.
